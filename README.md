# Hi, I am Antonija

### Self-taught Frontend Developer


Ah, let me share my journey with you! Ever since I was young, I've been captivated by the idea of conversing with computers. There's something inherently fascinating about their sleek efficiency. And their mannerisms, oh, they can be quite the puzzle - simultaneously manipulative yet remarkably concise and understandable.

After a fulfilling career in banking, fate led me back to my true passion: technology. It all started with one job interview on the horizon and a curious exploration of YouTube's treasure trove of tips on interview preparation. Suddenly, it hit me like a bolt of lightning - a Eureka moment! I realized it was time to take the reins of my life and dive headfirst into acquiring the most exhilarating and potent skill in existence.

For me, it's all about the joy of creation. That's why I've chosen to embark on the thrilling frontier of frontend development. There's nothing quite like the satisfaction of visually crafting interactive experiences. It's a journey filled with excitement and endless possibilities!
